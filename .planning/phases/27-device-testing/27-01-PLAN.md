# Plan 27-01: Device Testing & Bug Fixes

## Objective

Test the mobile app on real iOS and Android devices, document any bugs or UI issues discovered, and fix critical issues blocking deployment.

## Execution Context

@bullion-tracker-mobile/src/screens/*.tsx
@bullion-tracker-mobile/src/components/**/*.tsx
@bullion-tracker-mobile/src/lib/*.ts
@bullion-tracker-mobile/src/contexts/*.tsx

## Context

Phase 26 shipped the circular carousel gallery with gesture-based lightbox. The app now needs comprehensive device testing before app store deployment.

**Key areas to test:**
- Authentication flows (login, signup, logout)
- Collection management (add, edit, delete items)
- Photo capture and display
- Circular carousel gallery interaction
- Lightbox gestures (swipe navigation, swipe dismiss)
- Portfolio dashboard and values
- Data sync with server
- Settings and preferences

**Known technical notes from Phase 26:**
- Uses React Native Animated API + PanResponder (not Reanimated Gestures) for Expo Go compatibility
- Circular carousel uses scroll-driven rotation

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Testing Checklist

Create a comprehensive testing checklist document that covers all screens and user flows.

**File:** `.planning/phases/27-device-testing/TESTING-CHECKLIST.md`

**Contents:**
- [ ] Authentication flows checklist
- [ ] Collection management checklist
- [ ] Photo/image handling checklist
- [ ] Gallery and lightbox checklist
- [ ] Dashboard and portfolio checklist
- [ ] Data sync checklist
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling checklist

---

### Task 2: iOS Device Testing (Human Required)

**Type:** Human verification checkpoint

Test all screens and flows on a physical iOS device (iPhone).

**Instructions for tester:**
1. Start the development server: `npm start` in bullion-tracker-mobile
2. Scan QR code with Expo Go app on iPhone
3. Work through each section of TESTING-CHECKLIST.md
4. Document any issues in BUG-REPORT.md with:
   - Screen/flow where issue occurred
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Severity (critical/major/minor/cosmetic)
   - Screenshot if applicable

**Pass criteria:**
- All checklist items tested
- No critical bugs remaining undocumented

---

### Task 3: Android Device Testing (Human Required)

**Type:** Human verification checkpoint

Test all screens and flows on a physical Android device.

**Instructions for tester:**
1. Start the development server: `npm start` in bullion-tracker-mobile
2. Scan QR code with Expo Go app on Android
3. Work through each section of TESTING-CHECKLIST.md
4. Add any Android-specific issues to BUG-REPORT.md
5. Note any platform differences

**Pass criteria:**
- All checklist items tested
- No critical bugs remaining undocumented

---

### Task 4: Document Bug Report

After iOS and Android testing, compile the bug report into a structured document.

**File:** `.planning/phases/27-device-testing/BUG-REPORT.md`

**Structure:**
- Critical bugs (must fix before deployment)
- Major bugs (should fix before deployment)
- Minor bugs (can fix in future update)
- Cosmetic issues (low priority)

---

### Task 5: Fix Critical Bugs

Fix any critical bugs identified during testing.

**Scope:** Depends on bugs discovered. Critical bugs typically include:
- App crashes
- Data loss scenarios
- Authentication failures
- Broken core functionality

**Process:**
1. Prioritize by severity
2. Fix one bug at a time
3. Test fix on affected platform
4. Update BUG-REPORT.md with resolution

---

### Task 6: Fix Major Bugs

Fix major bugs that would significantly impact user experience.

**Scope:** Depends on bugs discovered. Major bugs typically include:
- UI elements not responding
- Incorrect data display
- Navigation issues
- Performance problems

---

### Task 7: Verify Data Sync

Test data synchronization between mobile app and server.

**Test scenarios:**
1. Add item on mobile, verify appears on web
2. Edit item on mobile, verify changes sync
3. Delete item on mobile, verify removed from server
4. Offline behavior (if applicable)
5. Conflict resolution (if applicable)

---

### Task 8: Regression Testing (Human Required)

**Type:** Human verification checkpoint

After bug fixes, do a final pass through critical flows.

**Instructions for tester:**
1. Test login/logout flow
2. Add a new item with photo
3. View item in gallery and lightbox
4. Edit item details
5. Check dashboard values update
6. Delete item

**Pass criteria:**
- All critical flows work correctly
- No regressions from bug fixes

## Verification

- [ ] TESTING-CHECKLIST.md created and comprehensive
- [ ] iOS device testing completed
- [ ] Android device testing completed
- [ ] BUG-REPORT.md documents all discovered issues
- [ ] Critical bugs fixed and verified
- [ ] Major bugs fixed or deferred with justification
- [ ] Data sync verified working
- [ ] Regression testing passed

## Success Criteria

1. App tested on both iOS and Android physical devices
2. All critical bugs fixed
3. Data sync verified working reliably
4. Documentation ready for Phase 28 (Performance & Error Handling)

## Output

- `.planning/phases/27-device-testing/TESTING-CHECKLIST.md`
- `.planning/phases/27-device-testing/BUG-REPORT.md`
- Bug fixes committed to codebase
- Updated STATE.md with phase completion
