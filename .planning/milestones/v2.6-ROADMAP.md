## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Standard KeyboardAvoidingView over third-party keyboard library (Phase 63)
- InputAccessoryView for iOS toolbar; Android uses native returnKeyType (Phase 63)
- Complex form components excluded from keyboard ref chain (Phase 63)
- 16px marginBottom as Input default, overridable via containerStyle (Phase 64)
- Migrated Input inline styles to StyleSheet.create (Phase 64)
- Consistent section header style across forms: fontSize 11, fontWeight 700, #9CA3AF (Phase 64)

**Issues Resolved:**
- None — clean execution across all phases

**Issues Deferred:**
- Expired JWT token issue on simulator (loadStoredAuth doesn't check expiry) — existing known issue, not related to v2.6

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
