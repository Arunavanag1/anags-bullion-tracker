## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Standard privacy policy template for collection tracking app
- Email-only contact method for simplicity and reliability
- Mobile links use Linking API to open web URLs in browser
- Client components with styled-jsx for consistent styling
- Deployed to Vercel with Neon database

**Issues Resolved:**
- styled-jsx requires client components (added 'use client' directive)
- Vercel deployment configuration (function paths for App Router)
- Supabase IPv4 limitation (switched to Neon for free tier compatibility)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Custom domain (bulliontracker.app) - using Vercel URL for now
- Contact form - using email-only approach
